PROBLEM SET 3

- Før inn målet med oppgaven i introduksjonen
- Før inn teori om velocity Verlet og Eulers metode


3a) (-> Metode)
- Discretize the differential equations
- Set up an algorithm for solving these equations using Euler’s forward algorithm
- and the so-called velocity Verlet method.


3b)(->Metode - Implementation)
-Write a program which solves the differential equations for the
Earth-Sun system
-using Euler’s method
-and the velocity Verlet method


3c) (-> Resultat)
-Find out which initial value for the velocity that gives a circular orbit
-test the stability of your algorithm as function of different time steps ∆t.
-Make a plot of the results you obtain for the position of the Earth orbiting
the Sun
-Check for the case of a circular orbit that both the kinetic and the potential
energies are conserved.
-Check if the angular momentum is conserved.
-Explain why these quantities should be conserved. (->Metode)
-Discuss eventual differences between the Verlet algorithm and the Euler algorithm.
(-> Metode)
-Consider the number of FLOPs involved
-perform a timing of the two algorithms for equal final times.


! USE VELOCITY VERLET IN THE REMAINING PART OF THE PROJECT!

3d) (-> Metode & Resultat)
-Find out by trial and error what the initial velocity must be in order for the
planet to escape from the sun.
- Can you find an exact answer?
-How does that match your numerical results?
-Change the gravitational force: What happens to the earth-sun system when β
creeps towards 3?

3e)
The aim here is to find out how much Jupiter alters the Earth’s motion.
-Modify program by adding the magnitude of the force between the Earth and Jupiter.
-Modify your first-order differential equations in order to accomodate both the
motion of the Earth and Jupiter.
-Set up the algorithm
-plot the positions of the Earth and Jupiter using the velocity Verlet algorithm
-Discuss the stability of the solutions using your Verlet solver.
-Repeat the calculations by increasing the mass of Jupiter by a factor of 10
-Repeat the calculations by increasing the mass of Jupiter by a factor of 1000
-Plot the position of the Earth.
-Study again the stability of the Verlet solver.

3f)
-carry out a real three-body calculation where all three systems are in motion
-Give the Sun an initial velocity which makes the total momentum of the system
exactly zero.
-Compare these results with those from the previous exercise and comment your
results.
-Extend your program to include all planets in the solar system, discuss results
- Use the above NASA's data to set up the initial positions and velocities for
all planets.

3g)
-Run a simulation over one century of Mercury’s orbit around the Sun with no
other planets present
-Check the value of the perihelion angle θp.
-Make sure that the time resolution used in your simulation is sufficient,
e.g. check that the perihelion precession you get with a pure Newtonian force
is at least a few orders of magnitude smalle than the observed perihelion
precession of Mercury
-Can the observed perihelion precession of Mercury be explained by the general
theory of relativity?


Also)
-Make unit tests!
